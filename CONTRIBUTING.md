# Contributing to YARG
If you'd like to contribute to YARG, you're in the right place! Whether you are an artist or a programmer, your addition to YARG matters.
That being said, there are rules you have to follow which will be outlined in this document.
**If a rule is broken, your contribution may not be accepted.**

## Organization
To stay organized, please join our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/sqpu4R552r). This will allow people to talk about ideas, or get help. This is especially useful for artists, as they do not have to deal with GitHub if they are not familiar with it. It's recommended that you ask there before working on something, in case someone is already working on feature/change, or there's a reason why we haven't implemented it.

A basic todo list can be accessed [here](https://yarg.youtrack.cloud/agiles/147-7/current), which has important features for the upcoming update(s). If you don't know what to do, looking here is a good start! However, if you want to change something that isn't here, feel free to do so as well.

## Rules

1. All PRs must be on the `dev` branch. PRs on the `master` branch will not be accepted.
1. All content/assets **MUST** be originally made, or be public domain. **NO RIPPING ASSETS FROM OTHER GAMES.** Your PR will immediately be denied.
2. If you add source code from other libraries, or just add other libraries, **please check if the liceneses are compatible**. If they are not, your PR will also be denied.
4. Please try to follow code styling. Most IDEs should be able to detect it from the `.editorconfig` file.
